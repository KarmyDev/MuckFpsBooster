1. Move the FpsBooster.dll to the BepInEx plugins folder.
2. Run modded Muck.
3. In the Settings, in the Graphics tab you should see two new options:
	one of them being "Render Distance",
	and second called "Enable Post Processing"

For the best performance set Render distance to 250 (default is 3000) and disable post processing.
